# Experimental-Design
Thinkful Academy project for experimental design

This project focuses on implementing a statistical test (t-test) to two groups in a single dataset and establishes a signifficant difference between the two groups.

In this case, I analyze the difference in medical costs between a group of smokers and non-smokers.

This project uses Jupyter Notebooks for reproducibility and ease of understanding.

This project was fully written in Python and its libraries, including Pandas and Numpy for data exploration, Seaborn and Pyplot for visualization, and statsmodels for statistical testing
